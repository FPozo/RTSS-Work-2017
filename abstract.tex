%The use of computer simulations can help to evaluate the performance of real-time data networks and detect potential issues that compromise the ultimate goal of providing timely and reliable communications. A theoretical analysis over components of the communication system such as the physical layer, medium access, or routing, is too complex or only able to cover pessimistic cases. Further, simulations must include all aspects that are relevant for the performance evaluation. Wireless communication is subject to phenomena like fading, shadowing, etc. which are not always included in simulations. Still, advantages like mobility, flexibility in the deployment or reduced cost and weight might trigger the consideration of wireless communications. Instead of completely replacing wired links, wireless links are often seen as a complement to wired networks, enabling new application domains. At the same time, there is a trend towards the convergence between networks for industrial, automotive or aerospace fields serving real-time requirements and networks for office and home environments that focus on throughput at the cost of offering a best-effort service. Important to mention is that message scheduling is crucial in the design of a real-time communication systems. Unlike event-triggered message dispatching, in the time-triggered paradigm the instants when transmissions are done are pre-defined, having the advantage that the behaviour of scheduled message transmissions are always known which simplifies its safety certification. Unfortunately, accessing the medium does not guarantee that the message will be delivered. Although absolute guarantees cannot be given, simulation can help to evaluate if sufficient reliability is provided for the transmissions and if the timing requirements can be kept.

The use of computer simulations can help to evaluate the performance of real-time data networks and detect potential issues that compromise the ultimate goal of providing timely and reliable communications. A theoretical analysis over components of the communication system such as the physical layer, medium access, or routing protocols might be too complex or only able to cover pessimistic cases. Further, simulations must include all aspects that are relevant for the performance evaluation. In our case, we are interested in simulating hybrid wired/wireless networks, with special focus on emulating problems like fading, shadowing or interference, which are generally more relevant in wireless links. Despite these problems, advantages like mobility, flexibility in the deployment or reduced cost and weight might trigger the consideration of wireless communications. Instead of completely replacing wired links, wireless links are often seen as a complement to wired networks, enabling new application domains. A crucial aspect in the design of a real-time communication system is message scheduling. Even so, a schedule that guarantees the access to the medium does not assure that the message will be delivered. Although absolute guarantees cannot be given, simulation can help to evaluate if sufficient reliability is provided for the transmissions and if the timing requirements can be kept. 

This work aims at providing a simulation platform to test hybrid wired/wireless networks where both time-triggered real-time and non-real-time traffic travel seemingly over different transmission media.

%This work aims at providing a simulation platform to test hybrid wired/wireless networks where both time-triggered real-time and non-real-time traffic travel seemingly over different transmission media. The simulation platform proposed in this work consists of four main software components: network and traffic generator, traffic scheduler, network simulator and results processing. Each software component uses a file or set of files to interface with other components.

To do so, the user starts defining the networks and parameters that wants to simulate in an input file. The simulation tool is executed using a \textit{makefile} that will perform a different simulation for every set of parameters given and returns performance measures in terms of reliability and message delays.

Internally, the simulation platform consists of four main software components: network and traffic generator, traffic scheduler, network simulator and results processing. In Figure \ref{fig:toolchain-architecture} we can see how each software component interfaces with others using a file or set of files. In the next paragraphs we go more into detail into the function of each component.

The network and traffic generator creates a network with the topology given by the user and generates the network traffic following the traffic specified. Note that it is possible to specify more than one network and traffic, which will create multiple simulation configurations. The network is composed of four types of devices: wired end-systems, wireless end-systems, switches and access points. End-systems are responsible to send and receive traffic, while switches and access points relay messages through the network, creating multi-hop paths between end-systems. Access points serve to interface between wired and wireless media. The traffic is generated in form of messages, containing information of its size, period and deadline, that can be sent from one end system to any group of end systems of the network.

%The network and traffic generator is capable of producing the network topology and incorporate different traffic profiles defined by the user in a configuration file. The network is composed of four types of devices: wired end-systems, wireless end-systems, switches and access points. Wired end-systems and wireless end-systems are responsible to send and receive traffic and only differ between each other with the capabilities of receiving wireless communication for the wireless end-systems. Switches are responsible of relaying the messages through the network, creating multi-hop paths between end-systems, while access points, connected to a switch, transmit and receives messages in the wireless medium to and from wireless end-systems. The traffic is generated in form of messages, containing information of its size, period and deadline, that can be sent from one end system to any group of end systems of the network.

The traffic scheduler implements a scheduling algorithm capable of generating schedules for large and complex networks. It is developed using a combination of segmentation approaches and a Satisfiability Modelo Theory (SMT) Solver. It takes as input the network and traffic generated before-hand and assigns the transmission times for all the messages in the network while satisfying its constraints.

The network simulator is developed in the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation framework. The basic components of an OMNeT++ simulation are the modules, the pieces where the functionality is implemented. Modules are connected to each other using gates and exchange information using message passing. The modules are partially described using the NED language from OMNeT++, that specifies the parameters, gates and nested modules, while the functionality is programmed in C++. The simulator initialization file is used to give value to the module parameters. The values can be grouped with labels that define different configurations, each specifying a set of values for the module parameters. The four types of network devices are able to dispatch messages in a time-triggered manner following the corresponding link schedule. The wired and wireless devices are based on IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 respectively, with a modified medium access control (MAC) layer. Inside the MAC, queues are FIFO, and traffic of different classes is segregated into different queues. Several mechanisms are incorporated to increase the reliability of wireless links, including retransmissions and cognitive radio. To test the reliability of the wireless links, interference emulating CSMA and jamming at different levels of intensity, size of burst and frequency hopping is envisaged. The simulation can run with a graphical environment or using the command line. The results are provided in three types of files: scalar and vectorial result files and log file. Scalar and vectorial result files retrieve statistics and vectors of raw data, including, e.g., number of packets sent and received or the instants when those packets are sent. The log file includes entries about relevant events and the time at which they happened.

The results processing tool takes the simulation log file as an input and evaluates whether the logic and timing of the events is according to the MAC protocol design and the schedule.

%In order to facilitate the use of the simulation tool, a single file records all the parameters required by the user. To build the set of tools and run them, a makefile is created.
